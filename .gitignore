# See https:/help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/rorapi/.bundle

/rorapi/config/database.yml

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/rorapi/log/*
/rorapi/tmp/*
/rorapi/log/.keep
/rorapi/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/rorapi/tmp/pids/*
/rorapi/tmp/pids/
/rorapi/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/rorapi/storage/*
/rorapi/storage/.keep

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/rorapi/config/master.key
